Using `numpy`'s `.log()` function, plot the log of the rank of the word's usage (e.g. \"said\" is rank 1, \"bilbo\" is rank 2, \"could\" is rank 3\", etc.) on the horizontal axis, and the log of the word's total usage on the vertical axis. Plot this as a scatter plot. What you will see is a demonstration of <i>Zipf's Law</i>, which is an observed phenomenon in human language. Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word in a piece of text is inversely proportional to the rank of that word, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law</a>.\n",
