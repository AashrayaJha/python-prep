Stop words are commonly used words in a language that do not significantly contribute to the content of the text, for example the word \"the\". In the `data` folder there is `stopwords.csv` which contains a list of English stop words. Use this list to produce a word count `DataFrame` that does not contain these stop words. Then reexamine the top 25 words."

    "10. Using `numpy`'s `.log()` function, plot the log of the rank of the word's usage (e.g. \"hamlet\" is rank 1, \"lord\" is rank 2, \"king\" is rank 3\", etc.) on the horizontal axis, and the log of the word's total usage on the vertical axis. Plot this as a scatter plot. What you will see is a demonstration of <i>Zipf's Law</i>, which is an observed phenomenon in human language. Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word in a piece of text is inversely proportional to the rank of that word, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law</a>.\n",
