# Python Prep Content
##### Last Updated March 8, 2023

This repository will contain all of our python prep content. Those individuals wishing to complete our Data Science Boot Camp will need
to understand all of the content covered in this repository.

## Repository Content

### Lectures

These lectures will present python coding through a series of jupyter notebooks. Lectures have corresponding videos which can be found here, https://www.erdosinstitute.org/programs/asynchronous/python-prep.
Each lecture notebook will have two versions:
1. An empty version that you can fill in and play around with as desired,
2. A "Complete" version that was filled in while recording the lecture video.


### Practice Problems

This folder contains jupyter notebooks full of practice problems. Unless otherwise stated, each lecture notebook has a corresponding practice problem
notebook for you to test your skills after completing the lecture. You should strive to reach a competency with the content so that you are able
to complete these notebooks relatively quickly.

### Data

The data folder contains the data used in the various jupyter notebooks in the repository.
